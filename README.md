# Todo App Backend

## Description
This is my first backend application built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **Mongoose**, and **MongoDB**. It features user authentication using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**, allowing users to sign up with an email and password, log in, and get an authentication token for accessing protected routes. The app also includes full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing todos. This project is an exploration of backend development and showcases my growing skills in handling server-side logic.

## Features
- User registration and login with email and password
- Authentication using JWT for secure access to protected routes
- CRUD operations for managing todo items
- Data stored in MongoDB using Mongoose
- Structured code following MVC design pattern

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js** - Server-side JavaScript runtime
- **Express.js** - Web framework for Node.js
- **MongoDB** - NoSQL database
- **Mongoose** - ODM library for MongoDB
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** - For user authentication
